# 🎄 Advent of Code 2025 – My Solutions

Welcome!  
This repository contains my **personal solutions to Advent of Code 2025**.

I’m solving the puzzles using **different programming languages and build systems**, but I keep the **folder structure consistent** across all days so everything stays easy to navigate.

---

## 📁 Project Structure

Every day follows the same hierarchy:

```text
dayXX/
├── src/        # All source code for the solution
├── input/      # Your personal puzzle input
│   └── input.txt
├── run-pt1.sh  # Script to run Part 1
└── run-pt2.sh  # Script to run Part 2
```


### 🧩 Folder Details

- **`src/`**  
  Contains all the code needed to solve that day’s puzzle.

- **`run-pt1.sh` & `run-pt2.sh`**  
  These scripts will:
  1. Compile the program (if needed)
  2. Run the solution for the selected part
  3. Log the output
  4. Clean up any compiled/generated files afterward
  
- **`input/`**  
  Place your personal puzzle input here.  
  ⚠️ The file **must be named `input.txt`** for the scripts to work.

## 🚫 A Friendly Disclaimer

While you’re free to look around, **copying my solutions to get your own answers is strongly discouraged**.

Advent of Code is all about learning and problem-solving — outsourcing that experience kind of defeats the point 😉  
Write your own code, struggle a little, debug a lot, and enjoy the process.

## 🎁 Have Fun!

That’s it.  
Enjoy Advent of Code, have fun experimenting with new ideas and languages, and most importantly:

**Merry Christmas & happy coding! 🎄✨**
